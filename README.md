# MULTITHREADED-FILE-COMPRESSION-TOOL

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: RISHI RAJ YADAV

INTERN ID: CT06DG114

DOMAIN: C++ PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

-> This project is a simple yet effective C++ application that demonstrates the use of multithreading to optimize the performance of file compression and decompression operations. Built as       part of a performance-focused systems programming assignment, the tool splits the input file into chunks and processes each chunk in a separate thread — thus significantly speeding up the     overall task on multi-core processors.

-> The core idea is to leverage C++ standard threading (std::thread) and mutexes to handle concurrent read/write operations safely and efficiently. The compression logic uses a basic but         demonstrative algorithm (e.g. Run-Length Encoding or similar), making it easy to understand, extend, and benchmark.

-> This project highlights how multithreading can be used to parallelize file-processing tasks in real-world applications like archivers, data backup tools, or data transmission utilities. It    is well-suited for academic or internship-level deliverables that focus on practical C++ multithreading, file handling, and performance gains through parallelism.

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
-> Multithreading using std::thread

-> Thread-safe output with std::mutex

-> Chunk-based file splitting and processing

-> Simple file compression (e.g., Run-Length Encoding)

-> Decompression logic to restore original content

-> Performance optimization through parallel processing

-> Use of file streams for large file handling
